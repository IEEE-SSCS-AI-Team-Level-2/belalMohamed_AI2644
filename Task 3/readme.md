## 📌 Overview

EGYBank is a complete banking management system built from scratch using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the SOLID design principles. It includes a clean web interface powered by Streamlit and persists all data in CSV files.

This project was built as part of the **IEEE SSCS AI Team** and is designed to demonstrate professional-grade Python code structure, SOLID architecture, and separation of concerns.

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Used

| Concept | Where Used |
|---|---|
| **Classes & Instance Attributes** | `User`, `Transaction`, `BankSystem` |
| **`@dataclass`** | `User`, `Transaction` — clean boilerplate-free models |
| **Magic/Dunder Methods** | `__str__`, `__repr__` on `User` and `Transaction` |
| **Class Methods** | `User.from_dict()`, `Transaction.from_dict()` — alternative constructors |
| **Encapsulation** | Private helpers `_hash_password`, `_get_user_or_raise` in `BankSystem` |
| **Inheritance** | `CSVUserRepository` inherits from `IUserRepository` |
| **Abstract Base Classes** | `IUserRepository`, `ITransactionRepository` in `interfaces.py` |
| **Polymorphism** | `BankSystem` accepts any `IUserRepository` — CSV, DB, mock |
| **Enum** | `TransactionType` for type-safe operation categorization |
| **Custom Exception** | `BankingError` for precise error handling |
| **Composition** | `BankSystem` has-a repository (not inherits-from) |

## 🏛️ SOLID Principles

### S — Single Responsibility
Each class has exactly one reason to change:
- `User` → stores user data only
- `BankSystem` → banking logic only
- `CSVUserRepository` → CSV file operations only
- `app.py` → UI only

### O — Open/Closed
`TransactionType` (Enum) can be extended with new types without modifying any existing code.

### L — Liskov Substitution
`CSVUserRepository` can be dropped in anywhere an `IUserRepository` is expected — without breaking anything.

### I — Interface Segregation
Storage is split into `IUserRepository` and `ITransactionRepository` — classes only implement what they need.

### D — Dependency Inversion
`BankSystem` depends on **abstractions** (`IUserRepository`), not on `CSVUserRepository` directly. Swap the storage backend by changing two lines in `app.py`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/banking-system.git
cd banking-system
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Passwords are **never stored in plain text** — they are hashed with SHA-256 before being saved.
- Account deletion requires password confirmation.
- Password updates require the current password.
